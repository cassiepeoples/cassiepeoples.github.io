            <h2>I am a Believer </h2>
            <p>The Apostles Creed</p> 
            <p>I believe in God, the father almighty, creator of heaven and earth.</p>
            <p>I believe in Jesus Christ, his only son, our Lord.</p>
            <p>He was concieived by the Holy Spirit and born of the Virgin Mary.</p>
            <p>He suffered under Pontius Pilate, was crucified, died, and was buried.</p>
        <p>He desceded to the dead.</p><p>On the third day he rose again.</p><p>He asceded into heaven and is seated at the right hand of the Father.</p><p>He will come again to judge the living and the dead.</p><p>I believe in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Catholic Church, the communion of Saints, the forgiveness of sins, the resurrection of the body, and the life everlasting. Amen.</p>
