            <h2>Your Dreams Are Possible </h2>
            <p> As a little girl I had dreams of being a college athlete and working my way to becoming a professional. I was motivated by the will to be the best.</p><p>In order to do so, I have had to treat every aspect of my life as an investment. I have had to invest in taking care of my body, I have had to invest a lot of time away from friends and hanging out.</p><p> Every second, every minute, every hour consists of living, sleeping, and eating basketball. The road has not been easy, but anything worth having is not easy. I am motivated knowing that I am one step closer to my dream.  </p> <img src="pics/welcomephotome.jpeg" width="50%%" height="50%%" title="Welcome" alt="Cassie Peoples"/>
