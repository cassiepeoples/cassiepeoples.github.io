 <p>My name is  <a href="http://www.gatorzone.com/basketball/women/bios.php?year=2013&player_id=43" target="_blank" title="Roster">Cassie Peoples</a> and I am twenty-one years old. I am currently in my third year of college at the University of Florida in Gainesville. Although I currently reside in Gainesville, I consider my home to be in San Antonio, Texas where I was born and raised. I believe in putting God first in everything I do and to always thank Him for the many blessings in life. In saying this, it is fair to say that God has blessed me with a wonderful supportive family. I am the oldest and only girl of four children. I have three younger brothers. Thier names are Marcus Jr.(18), Logan (7), and Braden (3).</p>

<p>Throughout my career playing basketball as a high school athlete, I was blessed with much success. I was honored to be a part of one of my high school's State Championship teams during my junior year. Soon following, I was invited to try out for a spot on the USA nineteen and under basketball team in Colorado Springs, Colorado. I soon heard back that I had earned a spot on the USA nineteen and under team. After a week of competition my team was honored with a gold medal. It was truly an honor to be apart of something that was truly bigger than basketball.</p>

<p>To conclude my high school career, I was selected to be a <a href="http://www.mcdonaldsallamerican.com/aag/en/home.html" target="_blank" title="McDonald All- American Website">McDonald All- American</a>. Myself along with twenty other girls in my graduating class across the country were flown into Chicago for a week. My favorite part of that week was when we went to a Ronald McDonald house where we met with families and their children who were affected by cancer. The whole week had very little to do with playing basketball and more about serving others in need. </p>

<p>When I finish my college career I hope to have left an impact on peoples lives. I truly believe that I have been given the talent to play basketball as a way to reach out and help others.
